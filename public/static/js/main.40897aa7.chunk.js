whichever is later.\\n\\nEmployers must allow employees to use safe and sick time for the following reasons:\\n\\n+ Tend to mental or physical illness, injury, or other health conditions \\n+ Care for family members (anyone they consider to be family)\\n+ Public health emergency \\n+ Seek help or take other safety measures for any act or threat of domestic violence, unwanted sexual contact, stalking, or human trafficking\\n\\nIf the use of time is unanticipated an employer may require notice of absence as soon as practical.  \\n\\n+ Any procedure or policy regarding the accrual, use and
